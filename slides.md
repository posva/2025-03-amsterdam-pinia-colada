Hello everyone! I'm Eduardo, or posva on GitHub and Twitter.

I'm the author of pinia, Vue Router, and other vue-related libraries like VueFire.

I have been part of the core team for a very long time, I think it's 8 years now.

During this journey I have encountered many different problems and I have tried to solve most of them.
Except for one, Data Fetching.

- UX couldn't exist, but idea did
- Ergonomics
- Feng shui: 4000 BC Ancient China, "The best space is one in which the arrangement of objects is aligned with the space's flow of energy"
- organize the space to make it harmonious and functional. Make the space feel good to be in.

### "If the point of contact between the product and people becomes a point of friction, then the designer has failed. If, on the other hand, people are made safer, more comfortable, more desirous of purchase, more efficient‚Äîor just plain happier‚Äîby contact with the product, then the designer has succeeded." {.text-white.bg-black/50.p-2.rounded-xl}

_Henry Dreyfuss - 1955_

<!--
- Henry Dreyfuss, industrial designer, 1955
- If the point of contact between the product and people becomes a point of friction, then the designer has failed. If, on the other hand, people are made safer, more comfortable, more desirous of purchase, more efficient‚Äîor just plain happier‚Äîby contact with the product, then the designer has succeeded
- Much closer to UI than feng shui and hippocrates
- 1st time we talk about failure
- before: as if one shot to get it right
- adapt? iterating?
- much closer to UI
- flow / friction

_Don Norman (1993)_

<!--
- Past: too idealistic. The reality is not flow
- 1955 idea of friction
- A browser's main point of contact is full of friction
- the URL bar
- The first thing you do, even before you see the website, is to wait for the page to load
- Let's take a static website with no javascript
-->

<!--
- as we load, we need to wait for things to appear
- By Henry Dreyfuss' definition, the browser's design has already failed
- notice how did you feel when the website loaded?
- who knew this website? website for a movie called spaced jam from 1996, 1 year after initial release of JS, 1y before the creation of the JS standard
- was it a positive feeling? raise
- for who was it negative?
- we haven't used the website, we already create an idea of it.
- studies show we form idea the first 50ms we see an interface. before the js loads for every application
- cognitive bias: halo effect. the way the space flows, still affects us (È£éÊ∞¥)
- So no, the browser design hasn't failed us because the friction here is not avoidable
- in fact, using the website becomes even worse

<!--
- all interactions make the user wait
- Nowadays nobody builds an app like this. In fact, just a website.
- async because we communicate with a server
- no need to show a video, you likely used app in the past few days
- likely had a frustration experience
- loading that hangs
- things that load but then show blank content
- that small stress of is it going work? I clicked back, did I break the form? Will I have to start my order all over again?
- That's the par that interests me
- Aesthetics subjective, hire a good designer
- managing loading state, errors, consistent way to make your app feel better

## Data fetching is easy ü§°


```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { fetchRecipeList, type Recipe } from "@/api";

const recipeList = shallowRef<Recipe[]>([]);
onMounted(async () => {
  recipeList.value = await fetchRecipeList();
});
</script>

<template>
  <ul>
    <RecipeCard v-for="recipe in recipeList" :key="recipe.id" :recipe />
  </ul>
</template>
```

<!--
- but worse than static because no loading
- you might be thinking you can use suspense and stick a skeleton ui

<!--
- there is nothing worse in UX that when we feel less efficient
- includes unexpected errors
- not feeling in control
- no feedback loop
- handle errors properly
- but unexpected errors always create frustration, but it's better to show something than nothing at all
- our goal is to reduce the wait time

## Pinia Colada

Vue plugin built on top of <logos-pinia></logos-pinia>!

- A query cache via `useQueryCache()` (a <logos-pinia/> store)
- Queries with `useQuery()`, `defineQueryOptions`, and `defineQuery()`
- Mutations with `useMutation()` and `defineMutation()`
- Light but extensible API

<!--
- what is it? Vue plugin, layer on top of pinia
- main parts of it
- query cache, simple client side cache, pinia store, centralize
- Queries are the async operations that read data. List of products, search result, some user's profile
- Mutations opposite, async operations that write data to server
- It's similar to GET/POST, but in practice a search can be a post
- light: ~3kb, lean an extensible API to adapt to your needs. important
-->

---
layout: center
---

```vue {5-11|9|10|6-7|16|18-20|21-25|27-27}{maxHeight:'410px'}
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useQuery } from '@pinia/colada'
import ProductItem from '@/components/ProductItem.vue'

const {
  state: productList,
  asyncStatus,
} = useQuery({
  key: ['products'],
  query: () => fetch('/api/products').then((res) => res.json()),
})
</script>

<template>
  <main>
    <LoadingIndicator v-if="asyncStatus === 'loading'" />

    <div v-if="productList.status === 'error'">
      <ErrorMessage :error="productList.error" />
    </div>
    <div v-else-if="productList.status === 'success'">
      <div v-for="product in productList.data" :key="product.id">
        <ProductItem :product />
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- v-else-if="productList.status === 'pending'" -->
    <SkeletonLoader v-else />
  </main>
</template>
```

<!--
- queries first and most important part
- [click]key how stored in cache
- The query can be reused in many places and the data is consistent 
- [click] query fn
- [click] get among other things, state, asyncStatus
- asyncStatus reflects any loading state: interesting = automatically refetches
-->

---

```ts
const {
  state: productList,
  asyncStatus,
} = useQuery({
  key: ['products'],
  query: () => fetch('/api/products').then((res) => res.json()),
})
```

Three different possible `state`s

| `state.status` | `state.data` | `state.error` |
| ------ | ---- | ----- |
| `'pending'` | `undefined` | `null` |
| `'success'` | _defined_ | `null` |
| `'error'` | `undefined` or _defined_ | _defined_ |

<!--
- works well with discriminated unions in TS
- not forced to use
-->

---

```ts{*|5,11-13|7,8|16}
import { useQuery } from '@pinia/colada'

const {
  // main query properties
  state,
  asyncStatus,
  refresh,
  refetch,
  isPlaceholderData,
  // convenient aliases
  error,
  data,
  status,
  // other...
} = useQuery({
  key: ['products'],
  query: () => fetch('/api/products').then((res) => res.json()),
})
```

<!-- 
- state has convenient accesses
- ability to refresh, which doesn't fetch if the data is fresh
- refetch
- on the surface, seems just like loading and error
- but what makes it so special?
- the key links them together
- can be called in many places, still just one source of data
-->

---
layout: center
---

````md magic-move
```ts
refresh()
refresh()
refresh()
refresh() // just one call!
```
```ts
const p1 = refresh()
refresh()
refresh()
const p2 = refresh()
p1 === p2 // true
await refresh()
```
````

<!--
- same with refreshes
- refresh will reuse any ongoing request and will avoid doing one if the data is fresh
- in practice, use refresh instead of refetch
- inconsistent updates of data create confusion and users loose trust
- centralized place for data = consistent state across your app
- ex: change avatar in user and it doesn't change in the navbar
-->

---
layout: center
---

## Centralized data

```ts{4,9}
const route = useRoute()
// gets the product with all its details
useQuery({
  key: ['products'],
  query: () => fetch('/api/products').then((res) => res.json()),
})

const queryCache = useQueryCache()
const productsEntry = queryCache.getEntries({ key: ['products'], exact: true }).at(0)

const {
  when,
  state,
  asyncStatus,
  active,
  pending,
  stale,
} = productsEntry
```

<!--
- by linking things though key
- access to the cache entries
- client cache not about replacing the server cache
- not reducing calls but making more at the right time
-->

---
layout: center
---

## The query cache

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useQueryCache } from '@pinia/colada'

const queryCache = useQueryCache()
</script>
```

<!--
- it's a client side cache
- why if on server
  - not about doing less requests
  - actually about doing more requests but at the appropriate time
-->

---
layout: center
---

## Fresh data

```ts{*|4}
useQuery({
  key: ['products'],
  query: () => fetch('/api/products').then((res) => res.json()),
  staleTime: 5000, // Data becomes stale after 5s
})
```

<!--
- concept of fresh vs stale data (like in cache)
- fresh data: is up to date
- stale data: is not up to date and should be prefetched
- noticed query has no argument
- automatically triggers a refetch if the data is stale
  - on foc
  - mount component with useQuery
- let the cache refetch for you
- hint it about outdated data
- reduce wait times a bit but do more
-->

## Response Times: The Three Important Limits

- **<=100ms**{.font-mono} : same as instant
- **<=1s**{.font-mono} : user stays in flow of thought
- **>=10s**{.font-mono} : context switch

###### [Jacob Nielsen - 1993](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/)

<!--
- 0.1s: is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is reacting instantaneously, meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result.
- 1s is about the limit for the user's flow of thought to stay uninterrupted, even though the user will notice the delay. Normally, no special feedback is necessary during delays of more than 0.1 but less than 1.0 second, but the user does lose the feeling of operating directly on the data.
- 10s is about the limit for keeping the user's attention focused on the dialogue. For longer delays, users will want to perform other tasks while waiting for the computer to finish, so they should be given feedback indicating when the computer expects to be done. Feedback during the delay is especially important if the response time is likely to be highly variable, since users will then not know what to expect.
- my API never gonna take 10s. Until you introduce AI
-->

---
layout: center
---

## Delay spinners

```ts{4-6|8-12}
import { PiniaColada } from '@pinia/colada'
import { PiniaColadaDelay } from '@pinia/colada-plugin-delay'

app.use(PiniaColada, {
  plugins: [PiniaColadaDelay()],
})

useQuery({
  key: ['products'],
  query: () => fetch('/api/products').then((res) => res.json()),
  delay: 400, // delays `asyncStatus`
})
```

<!--
- many ways of applying this
- Plugins later
- Plays with the perception of speed
-->

import { onSlideEnter } from '@slidev/client'
import { useTemplateRef } from 'vue'

const video = useTemplateRef('video')
onSlideEnter(() => {
  if (!video.value) {
    return
  }
  video.value.currentTime = 0
  video.value.play()
})
</script>

<script setup>
import { onSlideEnter } from '@slidev/client'
import { useTemplateRef } from 'vue'

const video = useTemplateRef('video')
onSlideEnter(() => {
  if (!video.value) {
    return
  }
  video.value.currentTime = 0
  video.value.play()
})
</script>

---
layout: center

## Mutations

```vue {*|9|5-7|20}{maxHeight:'410px'}
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useMutation } from '@pinia/colada'

const {
  mutate: createTodo,
  status,
  asyncStatus,
} = useMutation({
  mutation: (todoText: string) =>
    fetch('/api/todos', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ text: todoText }),
    }),
})

const todoText = ref('')
</script>

<template>
  <form @submit.prevent="createTodo(todoText)">
    <input v-model="todoText">
    <button :disabled="asyncStatus === 'loading'">
      Add todo
    </button>
  </form>
</template>
```

<!--
- another way of playing with perception of speed
- mutate fn only required
- gives access to the state, exactly like a query
- does not execute automatically, so it can take arguments
- most apps have both, queries and mutations
- key is to use them together, how?
-->

---
layout: center
---

## Mutations

```vue{*|18-22}{maxHeight:'410px'}
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useMutation, useQueryCache } from '@pinia/colada'
import { patchContact } from '@/api/contacts'
import type { Contact } from '@/api/contacts'
import ContactDetail from '@/components/ContactDetail.vue'

const props = defineProps<{ contact: Contact }>()

// we use the query cache to invalidate queries
const queryCache = useQueryCache()

const {
  mutate: updateContact,
  state,
  asyncStatus,
} = useMutation({
  mutation: (contact: Contact) => patchContact(contact),
  onSettled(updatedContact, error, contact) {
    // invalidate the contact list and detail queries
    // they will be refetched automatically if they are being used
    queryCache.invalidateQueries({ key: ['contacts'], exact: true })
    queryCache.invalidateQueries({ key: ['contacts', contact.id] })
  },
})
</script>

<template>
  <main>
    <LoadingIndicator v-if="asyncStatus === 'loading'" />

    <div v-if="state.error">
      <ErrorMessage :error="state.error" />
    </div>
    <div v-else>
      <ContactDetail
        :contact="props.contact"
        :is-updating="asyncStatus === 'loading'"
        @update="updateContact"
      />
    </div>
  </main>
</template>
```

<!--
- while queries are more common, mutations is where there is  more risk to create friction
- more likely errors
- a place full of opportunities
- know what the user is going to do next, what it's going to fetch
- so we can tell pinia colada, these queries needs to be prefetched
- that's what invalidates does, it cancels any ongoing queries, mark them as stale, and if they are active, fetches them
- mutation still finishes before the queries are loaded, but we can even await the invalidations
- if the queries used in the background, their loading state will reflect that, they will keep showing the old state while fetching
- how to show up to you:
  - Indicate that the data is being updated: e.gp a spinner, graying out the info, disabling the form (GitHub). the app is still usable in this time
- I recommend not showing the loading state too prominently, it shouldn' attract user's attention
- graying out is no to noticeable

# Query Cache

Powerful plugin API based on `$onAction()`

<!--
It's often forgotten that Pinia is not just a global state + devtools. The plugin API is what makes it really powerful.
Actions acts as events that you can interact with. Fetching, invalidating, cancelling, they all trigger different actions
-->

```ts {*|3|4|7-9|13|45-54}{maxHeight:'410px'}
export function PiniaColadaDelay(options?: PiniaColadaDelayOptions): PiniaColadaPlugin {
  return ({ queryCache, scope }) => {
    queryCache.$onAction(({ name, after }) => {

## Pinia Colada

- Avoid showing loading state too quickly
- Use centralized data to consistently show the same state
- Invalidate queries as soon as you know the data has changed
- Use optimistic updates to make the app feel faster
